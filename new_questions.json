"answer":"Consider an infinitely long straight conductor carrying current I. To find the magnetic field at a distance r from the conductor, we apply Ampere’s circuital law. According to Ampere’s law, ∮B.dl = μ₀I_enclosed. Choose a circular Amperian loop of radius r around the conductor. Due to symmetry, magnetic field B is constant at every point on the loop and is tangential to the loop. Therefore, B(2πr) = μ₀I.
